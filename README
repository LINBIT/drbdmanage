drbdmanage installation HowTo
==============================================================================


INSTALLATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prerequisites:
    DRBD 9 installed
    LVM installed
    python-dbus, python-gobject installed

IMPORTANT NOTICE:
The node names you enter must match the output of the "uname -n" command.

Installation procedure (all nodes):
    *  Install the drbdmanage package:
         rpm -i drbdmanage-0.11.1-noarch.rpm
    *  Create a VG named drbdpool

Cluster initialization (first drbdmanage cluster node only):
    *  On the first node, issue the following command to initialize a new
       drbdmanage cluster:
         drbdmanage init <ipaddress>
       ... where <ipaddress> is the IP address of the network interface that
           DRBD should use to communicate with other nodes in the cluster

Adding nodes to a drbdmanage cluster:
    *  On a node of the existing drbdmanage cluster, issue the following
       command to prepare the cluster for integrating a new node:
         drbdmanage new-node <nodename> <ipaddress>
       ... where <nodename> is the node name of the node, and <ipaddress>
           is the IP address of the node that will join the cluster
       This command will also generate the command line that needs to be
       entered on the new node to make it join the cluster
    * On the new node (the one that should join the cluster), enter the join
      command that you have received from the drbdmanage new-node command
      in the previous step (e.g., copy & paste)


CONFIGURATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to customize the settings of your drbdmanage server, you can
change its configuration by editing the following files:
  /etc/drbdmanaged.conf
  /etc/drbdmanaged-lvm.conf


Starting the drbdmanage server (daemon)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The drbdmanage server should be started automatically by D-Bus when the
drbdmanage client connects to it for the first time.

The following command can be used to check whether the drbdmanage client can
connect to the drbdmanage server, and it implicitly starts the server as
described above:
  drbdmanage ping

If the server has been started successfully or had been running already,
the response of the "ping" command is simply "pong"; otherwise, an
error message is displayed.

The server can also be started manually by issuing the following command:
  dbus-drbdmanaged-service &
